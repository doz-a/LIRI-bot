# node liri.js spotify-this-song "song name"
Searches Spotify API for the song name, responds with artist name, an album name and a song preview link

# node liri.js concert-this "artist name"
Searches bands in town API for an artist, and displays upcoming concerts with venue location and dates

# node liri.js do-what-it-says
